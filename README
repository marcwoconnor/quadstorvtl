QUADStor VTL installation guide

Prerequistes
------------

On FreeBSD 8.x/9.x:

pkg_add -r sudo apache22 gmake 
Additionally the kernel source /usr/sys/sys needs to be present

On RHEL/CentOS 5.x/6.x:

yum install httpd gcc perl kernel-devel sg3_utils

On SLES 11 SP1/SP2:

zypper install apache2 gcc perl kernel-default-devel sg3_utils

On Debian 6.x/7.x:

apt-get install uuid-runtime
apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install sg3-utils
apt-get install apache2
apt-get install psmisc
apt-get install firmware-qlogic (for FC access)
apt-get install linux-headers-{uname}
where {uname} can be got from the command 'uname -r'
# This an example on one of my containers running in proxmox
# Keep in mind you have to add a proxmox repo in order to pull the headers.
# apt-get install linux-headers-6.8.12-3-pve

If you have installed any of the release packages before, then you most likely have all the prerequistes installed.

Uninstallation
--------------

Go back to the location where the sources were built and run
./uninstallworld

uninstallworld removes most of the installed files except for custom configurationf files like /quadstorvtl/etc/quadstor.conf and the postgresql database data files under /quadstorvtl/pgsql/data. These will have to be manually removed if you are clearing out an installation. 
NOTE: /quadstorvtl/pgdata contains the configuration database of the software. This data is maintained even after an uninstall of the software and is required during upgrades. If this data were to manually removed all previous configuration such as configured storage, VTL information etc is lost. Refer to http://www.quadstor.com/support/131-recovering-from-a-lost-or-damaged-database.html to recover from a lost or damage database
